# ESPboy (ESP8266 gadget) port of the Arduboy2 library
This port of **"Arduboy2"** and **"Arduboy PlayTones"** libraries from [Arduboy project ](https://arduboy.com/ "Arduboy project ") intended to run on[ ESPboy project](https://hackaday.io/project/164830-espboy-games-iot-stem-for-education-fun " ESPboy project").

It supports ESPboy buttons, LED, sound (thanks to ported **"Arduboy PlayTones" library**) and TFT display.

This port compiles for ESP8266 ESPboy, existing Arduboy2-compatible games and apps. 
Some of them can use it as a drop-in replacement for the original **"Arduboy2" library**, other games will run after the slight modifications.

# Migrating the game from Arduboy to ESPboy
1. replace the **"Arduboy2" library** and **"Arduboy tones" library** in your Arduino Studio libraries folder with these versions.
2. do ingame modifications according to the following notes:
- change **"#include arduboy.h"** to **"#include arduboy2.h"**
- some games use a function pointer array to pass control to a different parts of the code as the game state changes. In ATMEGA32U4 the memory address is 2 bytes (single word) long, in ESP8266, the memory addresses is 4 bytes (double word) long, So you need to change all "pgm_read_word" to "pgm_read_dword" at the pointers
- if EEPROM is used by the game to keep configs/high scores,
-- add EEPROM.begin(100) at setup() // 100 is just a rough max no. need to check the size
-- add EEPROM.commit() after the last EEPROM.put(), EEPORM.write() and EEPROM.update() of each blocks of code.
- remove any reference to the **"ATMlib"**, **"ArduboyPlaytune"** that require timers to play background music. That libraries has not been ported yet.
- games that directly control the SPI or I2C bus to write to OLED display need much more work to port instead of the simple steps above.
- font() array is used in TFT_eSPI display library so you have to change all "font" to "font_"
- min() and max() macros are used in TFT_eSPI display library so you have to change all min() and max() to minVal() and maxVal() correspondenly
- there is a problem with a "char" data (this is the signed/unsigned problem). The game variables which are not really char or char* should be changed correspondingly "unsigned char" to "uint8_t" and "char" or "signed char" to "int8t". Don't forget to set #include "Arduino.h" at the first line.
- it's better to change all "short" to "int16_t", "unsigned shot" to "uint16_t", "byte" to "uint8_t", "int" to "int16_t", "unsigned int" to "uint16_t", "long" to "int32_t", "unsigned long" to "uint32_t" 


# Advantages of ESPboy (ESP8266)
- 8 keys
- TFT color LCD 128x128
- Faster MCU 80Mh/160Mhz
- RGB neopixel LED
- More memory for program and data.  http://0x04.net/~mwk/doc/xtensa.pdf
- Internal flash memory mounted as SPIFFS disk 4-16mb for additional data
- WiFi onboard opens up the possibility for online games, top scores posting online
- OTA (on the air firmware update) update the firmware through WiFi from a web site, the same way as Android playmarket/ Apple istore.
- Cheaper overall cost
